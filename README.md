# 💖 Funny Valentine Page

A tiny, cute, and playful single-page Valentine website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The page humorously asks **“Will you be my Valentine?”** and adds a fun twist — the **“No” button refuses to cooperate**, while the **“Yes” button triggers a celebration**.

Perfect as a small surprise for a partner or as a beginner front-end project.
